  <h1>How the Electoral College Skews Voting Power</h1>

      <div>If you're American and are at all interested in politics, chances are you have become very familiar with this map in the past year. It is a map of the US colored by the 2016 election results.</div>
      <div>Though Trump recieved almost 3 million fewer votes than his opponent, key wins in Michigan, Florida, and Pennsylvania allowed him to cinch the 270 electoral votes necessary to win the election.</div>
      <div>This made Trump the 5th person to ever become the president of the US while losing the popular vote, joining the ranks of John Quincy Adams (1824), Rutherford B. Hayes (1876), Benjamin Harrison (1888), and George W. Bush (2000). Clinton, on the other hand, joins losers such as Andrew Jackson (1824), Samuel Tilden (1876), Grover Cleveland (1888), and Al Gore (2000).</div>
      <div>The electoral college system has been frequently been criticized for its ability to create such discrepencies.</div>
      <div>Most states use a winner takes all system. As the name suggests, the candidate who gets more votes in the general election get all of the state's electoral votes, regardless of the margin.</div>
      <div>Only two states use a different system based on their Congressional Districts. Maine and Nebraska award 2 of their votes to the state's popular vote winner. Then, each Congressional Districts can award one vote to the winner of the district.</div>
      <div>In this map, the area of each state is proportional to the number of electoral the state has. This perspective, and other <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2012/">cartograms</a>, or maps that rescale the area of states based on their number of votes, like it, makes it look like states with high populations have a disproportionate voting power.</div>
      <div>In fact, one criticism of the Electoral College is that it concentrates electoral power in the hands of large states. The four most populated states--California (55), Texas (38), Florida (29), and New York (29)--hold a total of 151 electoral votes, or 28% of the 538 electoral votes, while 7 states (and Washington DC) only have 3 votes each.</div>
      <div>Thus, campaign money and media coverage is typically focused on a small number of states that are moderate and have a significant number of electoral votes.</div>
      <div>For example, in the 2016 election, about 90% of campaign events by Clinton and Trump were concentrated in just 11 states, according to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Lxw0vc4YBUwQ8cZouyewZvOGg6PyzS2mArWNe3iJcY/">FairVote</a>.</div>
      <div>Clinton's campaign events in Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania made up 70% of all her campaign events. Trump spread himself out a little more, but those same four states recieved about half of his campaign events.</div>
      <div>The rest of the states become ignored, either for being insignificant or impossible to win. California, for example, has voted Democratic in every presidential election since 1988.</div>


      <div>An alternative analysis of the electoral college tells a different, though equally problematic, story.</div>
      <div>By dividing the voting population of each state (from the 2015 census) by its number of electoral votes, each state's voting power per person can be estimated. For example, Wyoming has a rating of 3.09, meaning each voter in Wyoming has the power that three people would have in a simple one-person-one-vote system. California, on the other hand, has a rating of 0.84, meaning it takes 3.67 people in California to match the voting power of one person in Wyoming.</div>
      <div>Thus, this map instead scales the area of each state by its voting power per person. States with lower populations have significantly higher power than states with higher populations. Wyoming is the most extreme example, but voters in Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, Rhode Island, and Washington D.C. enjoy ratings over 2.</div>
      <div>Admittedly, this analysis simplifies certain notable variables. It fails to account for the voting record for each state. In that respect, a voter in Wyoming, which has voted for the Republican candidate every year since 1964, could be considered to have a lower <i>chance to be the deciding electoral vote</i>, and thus a lower effective voting power, while a swing voter in a swing state holds a disproportional amount of power.</div>
      <div>However, such examples should be seen as just further evidence of how the electoral college skews voting power between states.</div>
      <div>In a country that holds the ideal that all Americans should be given an equal vote, it seems to make little sense to that the weight of each person's vote should be based on their geographic location, a factor that is <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/mobility_of_the_population/cb11-193.html">more likely to be determined by birth than by choice</a>.</div>

      <h3>How the Electoral College Impacts Power by Demographics</h3>

      <div>Because of the uneven demographic distribution across the country, the compartmentalization has less obvious effects as well.</div>
      <div>The distribution of people by race, for example, causes </div>
      <div>The voting power of White Americans is increased by 3%.</div>
      <div>The voting power of Black Americans is about the same, with a slight increase of 0.4%.</div>
      <div>The voting power of Latinx Americans is decreased by 8%.</div>
      <div>And the voting power of Asian Americans is decreased by 12%.</div>
      <div>Furthermore, these statistics are calculated as <i>potential</i> electoral voting power. In other words, if <i>every</i> eligible voter cast a ballot in a presidential election, then, on average, it would take 117 Asian American votes to equal the votes of 100 White Americans. However, minority voters tend to vote at a lower rate. This may be due to a variety of <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/news/2014/11/06/100627/why-young-minority-and-low-income-citizens-dont-vote/">economic</a> or <a href="http://www.newsweek.com/voter-id-laws-texas-minority-voters-strict-states-582405">institutional</a> reasons.</div>
      <div>Thus, the electoral college further compounds the suppression of the minority voices in the presidential election.</div>

      <div>In the end, the calls for ending the electoral college are not just Democratic candidates being sore losers.</div>
      <div>Yes, Hillary Clinton has called for ending the electoral college in <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/13/politics/hillary-clinton-anderson-cooper-electoral-college-cnntv/">an interview with CNN</a>...</div>
      <div>But so, too, did Donald Trump in 2012.
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy.</p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href="https://twitter.com/9realDonaldTrump/status/266038556504494082">November 7, 2012</a></blockquote>
        <script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
      </div>
      <div>Yes, almost 5 million Democratic voters <a href="https://www.change.org/p/electoral-college-make-hillary-clinton-president-on-december-19-4a78160a-023c-4ff0-9069-53cee2a095a8">petitioned electors</a> to defy their electoral college mandates, but so, too, did Republicans <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/presidential-campaign/308379-remember-when-republicans-tried-to-stop-obama-with">lobby electors in 2008</a> to vote against Barack Obama in spite of their mandates.</div>
      <div>Instead, the call for obolishing the outdated electoral college is an issue motivated by restoring the one person, one vote ideal that holds all Americans equal in the eyes of the government.</div>
      <div>Of course, all voting systems have their flaws, but rethinking the importance of the electoral college just might make America's a little more equitable.</div>
