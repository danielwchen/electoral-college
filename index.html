But our elected officials don't quite line up. A majority of Congress consists of Climate Deniers. In fact, in 2014, <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/18/jerry-brown/jerry-brown-says-virtually-no-republican-believes-/">Politifact</a> claimed that there were only <span class="bodyemphasis">8 Republicans in Congress who did not deny the existence of climate change</span>. We've been a little more generous in our findings, but it appears that <span class="bodyemphasis">54% of Congress, and 95% of Republican Congressmen, are Climate Deniers.</span><br></div>

            <h3>Why don't our lawmakers agree?</h3>
            <div class="para"> It's up to us to hold our Congress members accountable to their constituents. In the visualization below, explore the different aspects of our representatives.
