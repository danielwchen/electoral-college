  <h1>How the Electoral College Skews Voting Power</h1>

      <div>If you're American and are at all interested in politics, chances are you have become very familiar with this map in the past year. It is a map of the US colored by the 2016 election results.</div>
      <div>Though Trump recieved almost 3 million fewer votes than his opponent, key wins in Michigan, Florida, and _______ allowed him to cinch the 270 electoral votes necessary to win the election.</div>
      <div>This made Trump the 5th person to ever become the president of the US while losing the popular vote, joining the ranks of John Quincy Adams (1824), Rutherford B. Hayes (1876), Benjamin Harrison (1888), and George W. Bush (2000). Clinton, on the other hand, joins losers such as Andrew Jackson (1824), Samuel Tilden (1876), Grover Cleveland (1888), and Al Gore (2000).</div>
      <div>The electoral college system has been frequently been criticized for its ability to create such discrepencies.</div>
      <div>Most states use a winner takes all system. As the name suggests, the candidate who gets more votes in the general election get all of the state's electoral votes, regardless of the margin.</div>
      <div>Only two states use a different system based on their Congressional Districts. Maine and Nebraska award 2 of their votes to the state's popular vote winner. Then, each Congressional Districts can award one vote to the winner of the district.</div>
      <div>In this map, the area of each state is proportional to the number of electoral the state has. This perspective, and other <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/election/2012/">cartograms</a>, or maps that rescale the area of states based on their number of votes, like it, makes it look like states with high populations have a disproportionate voting power.</div>
      <div>In fact, one criticism of the Electoral College is that it concentrates electoral power in the hands of large states. The four most populated states--California (55), Texas (38), Florida (29), and New York (29)--hold a total of 151 electoral votes, or 28% of the 538 electoral votes, while 7 states (and Washington DC) only have 3 votes each.</div>
      <div>Thus, campaign money and media coverage is typically focused on a small number of states that are moderate and have a significant number of electoral votes.</div>
      <div>For example, in the 2016 election, about 90% of campaign events by Clinton and Trump were concentrated in just 11 states, according to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14Lxw0vc4YBUwQ8cZouyewZvOGg6PyzS2mArWNe3iJcY/">FairVote</a>.</div>
      <div>Clinton's campaign events in Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania made up 70% of all her campaign events. Trump spread himself out a little more, but those same four states recieved about half of his campaign events.</div>
      <div>The rest of the states become ignored, either for being insignificant or impossible to win. California, for example, has voted Democratic in every presidential election since 1988.</div>


      <div>An alternative analysis of the electoral college tells a different, though equally problematic, story.</div>
      <div>By dividing the voting population of each state by its number of electoral votes.</div>


      <div>This compartmentalization has less obvious effects as well.</div>
